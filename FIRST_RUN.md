# 🚀 SuperClaude Ultimate - First Run Setup

**Welcome!** You've just installed the most powerful AI development framework ever created.

## What Just Happened?

When you cloned SuperClaude Ultimate, you got:
- ✅ **25 Smart Commands** (like `/build`, `/analyze`, `/test`)
- ✅ **9 Expert Personas** (frontend expert, security expert, etc.)
- ✅ **9 Specialized Agents** (for complex tasks)
- ✅ **Configuration Files** (everything pre-configured)

## What Still Needs Installing?

Some powerful tools need to be installed on your computer:
- 🔧 **Claude Code CLI** (the main AI assistant)
- 🔧 **6 MCP Servers** (specialized capabilities)
- 🔧 **Usage Monitor** (track your AI usage with graphs)
- 🔧 **Serena Toolkit** (advanced code analysis)

## Automatic Setup (Recommended)

**For everyone (including non-technical users):**

1. **Open your terminal** (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on Mac/Linux)

2. **Wait for the prompt** - SuperClaude will automatically detect it needs setup and ask:
   ```
   🔧 SETUP REQUIRED
   Would you like to install everything now? (y/n):
   ```

3. **Type `y` and press Enter** - Everything installs automatically (2-3 minutes)

4. **Done!** You'll see:
   ```
   🎉 Installation complete!
   ```

## Manual Setup (If Needed)

If the automatic prompt doesn't appear:

```bash
# Navigate to SuperClaude directory
cd ~/.claude

# Run installation script
chmod +x scripts/install.sh
./scripts/install.sh
```

## Test Everything Works

After installation, try these commands:

```bash
# Test SuperClaude commands
claude /analyze --help

# Test usage monitoring  
claude-monitor --version

# Test a real command
claude /monitor
```
